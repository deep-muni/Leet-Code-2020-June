# Leet-Code-June

I participated in Leet Code's June Coding Challenge and it was a great learning experience.

I have written the problem and solution for them in separate packages.

Since the challenge only provides the Solution function, to execute the program, 
I have written the calling function and other functions/classes if required.

Completion of Challenge
